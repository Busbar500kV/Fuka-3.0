🌌 The Physics of Fuka 3.0

A local, energy-aware, entropy-reducing, connection-based information physics

⸻

1. Events and Connections

Events
	•	The most primitive elements are events in space-time.
	•	Each event has a state vector \mathbf{s}_i(t), which represents whatever information or physical quantity we track.

Connections
	•	A connection is the smallest world-line between two neighboring events, say A and B.
	•	Its raw signal difference is:

\Delta \mathbf{s}_{AB}(t) = \mathbf{s}_B(t) - \mathbf{s}_A(t)

👉 Meaning: A connection is not just a link — it is the differential recorder of what separates two events. This makes it the fundamental carrier of information.

⸻

2. Local Entropy of a Connection

Connections must measure the uncertainty of their interaction.
	•	Local entropy is defined as:

S_{AB}(t) \approx \mathrm{Var}\!\Big(\Delta \mathbf{s}_{AB}(t-\tau : t)\Big)

where \tau is a small memory window.

👉 Meaning:
	•	If S is low → the connection is coherent and predictable.
	•	If S is high → the connection is noisy and unstable.

Entropy is the “cost” that the connection must fight against.

⸻

3. Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) of a Connection

Each connection has internal parameters (like knobs) that can be tuned to reduce entropy.
	•	Amplitude A_{AB}: strength of influence.
	•	Frequency f_{AB}: resonance with environment.
	•	Phase \phi_{AB}: temporal alignment.
	•	Curvature \kappa_{AB}: nonlinear bending of the relation.
	•	Plasticity \eta_{AB}: learning/adaptation rate.

👉 Meaning:
These DoFs are how a connection “learns” and “remembers.” They don’t represent neurons, but local resonance patterns.

⸻

4. Denoising by Encoding

The connection produces an encoded signal:

\hat{\Delta \mathbf{s}}{AB}(t) = A{AB}\,\sin(2\pi f_{AB}t + \phi_{AB}) + \kappa_{AB}\,\Delta \mathbf{s}_{AB}(t)

👉 Meaning:
This is the connection’s attempt to model its environment.
It uses its DoFs to align with noise and filter it into structure.

The DoFs update by gradient descent on entropy:

\theta_{AB}(t+1) = \theta_{AB}(t) - \eta_{AB}\,\nabla_\theta S_{AB}(t)

👉 Meaning:
Connections adapt themselves to locally reduce entropy. This is the essence of denoising.

⸻

5. Stability

A connection’s stability is defined as:

\text{Stability}{AB}(t) = \frac{1}{1 + S{AB}(t)}

👉 Meaning:
	•	Stable = coherent encoding → likely to survive.
	•	Unstable = noisy encoding → likely to be pruned.

⸻

6. Growth of New Connections

If a connection is very stable, its endpoints may try to grow new connections:

P(\text{grow}) \propto \text{Stability}_{AB}(t)\;\cdot\;\text{NeighborAvailability}

👉 Meaning:
Stable connections spread influence locally by allowing endpoints to reach out to neighbors.
No “spooky action at a distance” — growth is always through neighbors.

⸻

7. Pruning of Bad Connections

If entropy remains high:

S_{AB}(t) > \theta_{\text{prune}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{delete connection}

👉 Meaning:
Connections that can’t reduce uncertainty are cut off. This keeps the system lean.

⸻

8. Integration and Fitness

Two connections integrate if their DoFs align:

\text{Integration}(AB, BC) = \exp\!\Big(-\|\theta_{AB} - \theta_{BC}\|^2\Big)

Fitness of a connection is:

F_{AB} = \text{Stability}{AB} \cdot \sum{N \in \text{neighbors}} \text{Integration}(AB, N)

👉 Meaning:
	•	Standalone connections are local models.
	•	Integrated clusters are shared models.
	•	Fitness is higher for connections that are both stable and coherent with neighbors.

⸻

9. Energy & Free Energy Accounting

This is the thermodynamic core.

Each event i (and optionally each connection) has:
	•	Free energy F_i(t): usable energy.
	•	Bound energy B_i(t): dissipated, no longer usable.
	•	Temperature T_i(t): proxy for local noise.

Energy transport:

J_{i\to j}(t) = \gamma_{ij}\,(\mu_i - \mu_j)

F_i(t+\Delta t) = F_i(t) + \sum J_{j\to i}\Delta t - \sum J_{i\to j}\Delta t + S_i^+(t)\Delta t - W_i(t) - D_i(t)

B_i(t+\Delta t) = B_i(t) + D_i(t)

👉 Meaning:
	•	Free energy flows locally like a field.
	•	It can only enter at sources (S_i^+).
	•	Work and dissipation consume it.

Work cost of entropy reduction:

W_{AB}^{\min}(t) = \alpha_E\, T_{AB}(t)\, \max(0, \Delta S_{AB})

👉 Meaning:
Every reduction in entropy costs energy, proportional to local temperature.

⸻

10. Top-Down Abstract Attractors

Connections don’t learn alone — random local hypotheses appear as attractors.
	•	Each attractor k has parameters \psi_k, strength a_k, radius r_k.
	•	They bias entropy:

S^{\text{eff}}{XY} = S{XY} - a_k G_k(\theta_{XY}, \Delta s_{XY}; \psi_k)

👉 Meaning:
Attractors “pull” local connections toward a pattern — but they must pay energy to exist.

Random seeding:

\Pr(\text{spawn } k) = p_0 \cdot \mathbb{1}\{F \ge E_{\text{spawn}}\} \cdot \xi

Reward (selection):

R_k = \frac{\Delta S_k^+}{E_{k,\text{paid}} + \varepsilon} \cdot \overline{\text{Integration}}_k

Survival (replicator dynamics):

a_k \leftarrow a_k(1-\lambda_k\Delta t) + \eta_a a_k (R_k - \bar{R})\Delta t

👉 Meaning:
	•	Random attractors are seeded.
	•	Only those that reduce entropy efficiently and integrate with neighbors survive.
	•	They spread slowly to neighbors, but never jump globally.

⸻

11. Global Accounting

Define total energy:

E_{\text{tot}}(t) = \sum_i (F_i(t) + B_i(t)) + E_{\text{struct}}(t)

Change in total energy:

E_{\text{tot}}(t+\Delta t) - E_{\text{tot}}(t) = \sum_i S_i^+(t)\Delta t - E_{\text{leak}}

👉 Meaning:
	•	The system is conservative.
	•	The only way free energy enters is at sources.
	•	Everything else is redistribution, work, or dissipation.

⸻

🧭 Narrative Summary
	•	Events are points in space-time.
	•	Connections are world-lines that record differences.
	•	They have DoFs that adapt to reduce entropy.
	•	Stability keeps them alive; pruning removes noisy ones.
	•	Growth extends them through neighbors; integration makes larger models.
	•	All denoising costs energy, which flows locally and only enters at sources.
	•	Abstract attractors appear randomly, bias denoising, and survive only if they reduce entropy efficiently.
	•	The system as a whole is an ecosystem of connections, competing for stability, integration, and energy efficiency.
